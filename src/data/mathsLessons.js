    content: `
Numbers are the basic building blocks of mathematics. Numeration is the system of naming and writing numbers.

There are different types of numbers:
1. **Natural Numbers** – Counting numbers: 1, 2, 3, ...
2. **Whole Numbers** – Natural numbers + 0: 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
3. **Integers** – Whole numbers and their negatives: ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, ...
4. **Rational Numbers** – Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction: 1/2, 3, -4, 0.75
5. **Irrational Numbers** – Cannot be written as a fraction: √2, π
6. **Real Numbers** – All rational and irrational numbers

**Place Value and Face Value**:
- Place Value: The value depending on the position of the digit.  
  Example: In 452, the place value of 5 is 50.
- Face Value: The digit itself.  
  Example: In 452, the face value of 5 is 5.

**Number Bases**:
Number bases are different ways of writing numbers (e.g., base 2 is binary, base 10 is our normal system).
Example:  
- Binary of 5 is 101  
- Octal of 9 is 11  
    `,

  title: 'Fractions and Decimals',
  content: `
**Fractions** are numbers that represent parts of a whole.  
A fraction has two parts:  
- Numerator (top number): Number of parts taken  
- Denominator (bottom number): Total number of equal parts

Example:  
3/4 means 3 parts out of 4 equal parts.

**Types of Fractions**:
1. **Proper Fraction** – Numerator < Denominator (e.g. 2/5)
2. **Improper Fraction** – Numerator ≥ Denominator (e.g. 7/4)
3. **Mixed Number** – Combination of a whole number and a fraction (e.g. 1 ¾)

**Equivalent Fractions** – Fractions that look different but have the same value  
Example: 1/2 = 2/4 = 4/8

**Decimals** are numbers written with a decimal point.  
They are another way to express fractions.

Examples:  
- 0.5 = 1/2  
- 0.25 = 1/4  
- 1.75 = 1 + 3/4

**Converting Fractions to Decimals**:  
Divide the numerator by the denominator.  
Example: 3/4 = 3 ÷ 4 = 0.75

**Converting Decimals to Fractions**:  
Write the decimal over its place value and simplify.  
Example: 0.2 = 2/10 = 1/5
  `,
  conclusion: `
👉 In conclusion, fractions and decimals are two ways of representing numbers that are not whole. Being able to convert between them is an essential math skill.

  title: 'Algebra',
  content: `
**Algebra** is a branch of mathematics that uses letters (called variables) to represent unknown values.

### Common Terms in Algebra:
- **Variable**: A symbol (like x or y) used to represent a number.
- **Constant**: A fixed value (e.g. 2, 5, -3).
- **Expression**: A mathematical phrase combining numbers, variables, and operations.  
  Example: 3x + 2
- **Equation**: A statement that two expressions are equal.  
  Example: x + 5 = 10

### Solving Simple Equations:
To solve equations, isolate the variable on one side.

Example:  
x + 3 = 8  
Subtract 3 from both sides:  
x = 5

Another Example:  
2x = 12  
Divide both sides by 2:  
x = 6

### Like Terms:
Terms with the same variable and exponent.

Example:  
3x + 2x = 5x

### Substitution:
Replace the variable with a number to evaluate.

Example:  
If x = 2, then:  
4x + 1 = 4(2) + 1 = 9

**Geometry** is the branch of mathematics that deals with shapes, sizes, angles, and dimensions of objects.

### Basic Geometric Shapes:
- **Point**: A location with no size or shape.
- **Line**: A straight path that goes on forever in both directions.
- **Line Segment**: A part of a line with two endpoints.
- **Angle**: Formed when two lines meet at a point.
- **Triangle**: A shape with 3 sides and 3 angles.
- **Square**: A shape with 4 equal sides and 4 right angles.
- **Rectangle**: Like a square but opposite sides are equal.

### Types of Angles:
- **Acute Angle**: Less than 90°
- **Right Angle**: Exactly 90°
- **Obtuse Angle**: More than 90° but less than 180°

### Perimeter and Area:
- **Perimeter**: The total distance around a shape.  
  Example: For a rectangle → P = 2(l + w)
- **Area**: The space inside a shape.  
  Example: For a rectangle → A = l × w

### Example:
For a rectangle of length 5cm and width 3cm:  
Perimeter = 2(5 + 3) = 16cm  
Area = 5 × 3 = 15cm²

  title: 'Probability',
  content: `
**Probability** is the measure of how likely an event is to occur. It helps us predict the chance of events happening in the future.

### Basic Concepts:

- **Experiment**: An activity with an uncertain result (e.g. tossing a coin).
- **Outcome**: A possible result of an experiment (e.g. Heads).
- **Event**: A specific outcome or group of outcomes.
- **Sample Space**: All possible outcomes (e.g. {Heads, Tails}).

### Probability Formula:
\\[
P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}}
\\]

### Examples:

1. Tossing a Coin:
   - Sample Space = {Heads, Tails}
   - Probability of Heads = 1/2

2. Rolling a Die:
   - Sample Space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
   - Probability of getting a 3 = 1/6
   - Probability of getting an even number = 3/6 = 1/2

  title: 'Equations and Inequalities',
  content: `
Equations and inequalities are core to solving real-world problems.

🔸 Equations:
An equation states that two expressions are equal, often containing a variable.

To Solve Simple Equations:
1. Isolate the variable.
2. Use inverse operations.
3. Example:
   x – 3 = 7 ⇒ x = 7 + 3 ⇒ x = 10
4. Check by substituting back.

🔸 Inequalities:
An inequality shows that one side is greater or less than the other.
Symbols used:
- > means greater than
- < means less than
- ≥ means greater than or equal to
- ≤ means less than or equal to

To Solve Inequalities:
1. Treat like equations.
2. If multiplying/dividing by a negative, flip the inequality sign:
   Example: -2x ≥ 6 ⇒ x ≤ -3
3. Always check with a test number.

Examples:
1. Solve: 3x + 4 = 10
   ➤ 3x = 6 ⇒ x = 2

2. Solve: 5 – y > 2
   ➤ -y > -3 ⇒ y < 3

3. Solve: 2(x – 1) ≤ 8

  title: 'Percentage and Ratio',
  content: `
**Percentage** is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100.
The symbol used is **%**.

📌 Example:
- 50% means 50 out of 100.
- To find 25% of 200:  
  (25 ÷ 100) × 200 = 50

**How to Convert:**
- Fraction to Percentage: Multiply by 100  
  e.g. (3/4) × 100 = 75%
- Decimal to Percentage: Multiply by 100  
  e.g. 0.2 × 100 = 20%

---

**Ratio** is a comparison between two or more values.

📌 Example:
- The ratio of boys to girls in a class is 2:3.
- If there are 10 boys, how many girls?  
  2:3 = 10:x → Cross-multiply:  
  2x = 30 → x = 15 girls

**Simplifying Ratios:**
- Divide both sides by the greatest common factor (GCF).  
  e.g. 12:16 → divide both by 4 → 3:4
